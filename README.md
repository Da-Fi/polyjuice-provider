# Polyjuice Provider

godwoken-polyjuice compatible providers for ethereum library like [ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) and [web3js](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js).

now you can call your smart-contract on godwoken-polyjuice with metamask and eth address.

- Web3 compatible provider: `/packages/web3`
- ethers compatible provider: `/packages/ethers`

`note: this project is still under development, some API might be changed in the future.`

we will introduce more compatible provider (like truffle-hdwallet-provider) in future.
